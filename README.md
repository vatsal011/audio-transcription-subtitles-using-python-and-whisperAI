# Audio-transcription-subtitles-using-python-and-whisperAI

This Python program utilizes the Whisper AI language model to generate transcriptions and subtitles for audio files. It not only transcribes the audio but also organizes the transcribed text into an SRT file format, providing a convenient way to add integrate them with videos in any video editing software.

## Features

- Transcribe audio files into text.
- Format the transcribed text into SRT subtitles.
- Save the SRT file for easy integration into video editing software.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Use Google Colab if your desktop/laptop does not have a GPU for faster execution

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whisper-ai-subtitle-generator.git

2. Please make sure to replace the following placeholders. These will be the only changes you would need to do.
   a. root_path - path to folder having your source audio files.
   b. exit_path - path to folder to save final SRT files.

   A good practice would be to have a single root and exit folder. Copy audio files to the root folder and move files from exit folder after execution.

3. Run the jupyter notebook.

Please review the generated transcription files as AI generated output is not 100% accurate.
